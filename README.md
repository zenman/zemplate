Zemplate is a bare-bones WordPress theme that utilizes Foundation to act as a starting point for theme devleopers.

Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic markup, Zemplate is the perfect 'blank slate' for your WordPress projects.

Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, so you can use it for whatever you like — even your commercial projects.

For more information on the company that maintains Zemplate, see the Zenman website: http://zenman.com

Enjoy!
